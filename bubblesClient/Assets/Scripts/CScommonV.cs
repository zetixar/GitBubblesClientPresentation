//  Summary of messagery:
	
//  Client starts with a nodeID of -1.
//  Client sends myNetworkClient.Connect(serverIP, CScommon.serverPort)
//  Server handles MsgType.Connect, replies with gameSizeMsg with numNodes, numLinks and worldRadius
//	Client responds with initRequestMsg including a name
//	Server replies with a suite of reliable initMsgs and updateMsgs and linkMsgs that cover the whole world.

//	One half second later (so that hopefully client will already have world messages before getting a node reference), 
//  server will send a nodeIdMsg which contains their nodeId, which may be -1 if none are available.
//  If not -1, server also sends nameNodeIdmsg to all clients associating the name to the node,
//  and server will issue an initRevisionMsg of the changed DNA (reflecting that the node is mounted) to all clients.

//  If user clicks on a desired node to mount, client sends a requestNodeId for that node.
//	The server replies with a nodeIdMsg which either contains their old, unchanged bubble assignment
//  (which may have been -1) which indicates their request is denied for some reason, OR it contains an assigned nodeId 
//	(which may be different from the one requested).
//  Server also sends nameNodeIdmsg to all clients associating the name to the node.
//  If request granted, server will issue an initRevisionMsg of the changed DNA (reflecting that the node is mounted) to all connected clients.

//  When game is unpaused, server sends regular unreliable updateMsgs,
//  and irregularly sends reliable initRevisionMsgs and linkMsgs.

//  If server starts a new game, it issues a new gameSizeMsg to all connected clients.
